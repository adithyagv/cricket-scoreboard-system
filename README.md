Cricket Scoreboard System

Project Overview

The **Cricket Scoreboard System** is a Python-based application that utilizes SQL databases to store and manage match data. This system allows users to record and view cricket match details, including teams, players, scores, and statistics in real-time. It aims to provide an efficient way to track cricket matches and maintain records.

Features

- Add and manage team and player details.
- Record match details, including runs, wickets, overs, and extras.
- Live scoring system to update scores in real-time.
- View and export match summaries and statistics.
- SQL database integration for persistent storage of match data.
- User-friendly interface to navigate through match information.
  
 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for application development.
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**: Database system used for storing match records.
- **SQLite** (Optional): Local database support for lightweight use cases.
  
 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-scoreboard-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database setup**:
   - Set up a MySQL/PostgreSQL server or use SQLite for local use.
   - Run the provided SQL script (`schema.sql`) to create the necessary tables.
   - Update the database connection settings in the `config.py` file with your credentials.

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Usage

1. **Add Teams**: Enter team and player details before starting a match.
2. **Start a Match**: Record the toss, assign players, and start the match.
3. **Live Scoring**: Use the live scoreboard to record runs, wickets, overs, and other match events.
4. **View Statistics**: After the match, view and export detailed statistics and match summaries.

 Database Structure

- **Teams**: Stores team information.
- **Players**: Stores player details for each team.
- **Matches**: Tracks each matchâ€™s score, overs, wickets, and other data.
- **Statistics**: Records player-specific and team-specific statistics for each match.
